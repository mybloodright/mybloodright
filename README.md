<p align="center">this is for ponytown<br/>
<p align="center">whisper me to int, im offtab alot and wont be able to see public chat unless we're friended.<br/> 
im a bit shy and quiet or not wanting to talk most of the time,  
  so its nothing against you or anything. 
  <p align="center"> i dont accept random friend rqs, let me know if you do and i'll accept, we might have to talk a little first before i accept as well.
<p align="center"> if you're under 16 please don't interact with me — i'll hide you. i have no dni as i hide freely and block freely, dont ask other people to tell me to unhide you. i am also on the 18+ server for a reason.
<p align="center">laying by me is okay! c + h might not always be in my name but it's always okay — just keep ship interactions away, i have a partner and im uncomfortable with flirting unlike half of the people on here
<p align="center">carrd coming soon, or ask me for my socials!
